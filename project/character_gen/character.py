# RPG Character Generator
# Create a database filled with different character classes, stats that fall
# within each class’ restrictions (wizards could always have low strength but
# high magic for example), and maybe even a description generator populated
# with premade sentences pertaining to personality, skill, and history. For an
# interface, allow the user to select what kind of class or character they’d
# like, and a ROLL or GENERATE button that will fill in the rest.
#
# Bonus points: provide a print button that will produce a
# printer-friendly version of the character sheet.

'''
Default constructor creates random/empty values.
Call create method on Character object to populate with values
